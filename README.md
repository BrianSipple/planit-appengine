Planit
==========
Provides citizens with a mechanism to broadcast events (pick-up sports games, service projects, etc.) taking place in their communities and neighborhoods. More than a "Meetup" application, Planit's goal isn't just to coordinate activities, but also to find intuitive uses for such activity data thorugh geographic mapping, machine learning algorithms, and more. A main objective is to have an application that local municipalities and institutions can leverage to provide more effective services for their citizens.

Current AppEngine app is in early development and (intermittently) deployed at [planit-web.appsot.com](https://planit-web.appspot.com)

An Android application is also being developed, which will be able to communicate with the same backend

History
-------
This app was originally ideated at CodeCampMN 2013's hackathon in early November 2013 under the name "TextMyPark".  It was expanded on during Hack For MN in June 2014 with a name change to "PlanIt" 

A development project is underway to build Planit as a full-fledged Web/mobile application that integrates activities and events between citizens and local municipalities, institutions, organizations, etc... anywhere and everywhere in the world.
